UPDATE! 11/05/2020
tested working under archbang linux 0111, thanx to MrGreen!.
bouncer5GHz will deauth all unknown 5GHz clients connected to your
network @ the "same time".
Starting the timer requires you to press enter;
At the end of the timer, it will ask you to re-execute the script,
or exit.

This script "will" deauthenticate your 5GHz WiFi network.
enforcer5GHz.sh extension has been removed, it is now 
a function, less problems with sed.

still a work in progress.....

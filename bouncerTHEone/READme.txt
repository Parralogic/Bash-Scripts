"All" of the scripts associated with bouncer*
have been condensed into only two executables "bouncerTHEone and timer"

The scripts have also been encrypted with shc, just to prevent easy modification

If you see the msg bellow in an enforcer attack no worries.
Invalid destination MAC address.
"aireplay-ng --help" for help.

make bouncerTHEone and timer executable then, #if not already
just execute/run sudo ./bouncerTHEone in terminal

UPDATE! 11/22/2020
Added Manual-input; just in-case the common routers
are not recognized.
NOTE!
IF your wifi adapters are in monitor mode and no MYINFO and MYROUTER
files exist, the script will try to continue the...script but obviously will fail;
just check first if your adapters are in monitor mode in-case you get an error,
or just unplug the adapters and re-run the script, simple as that.

UPDATE! 11/23/2020
Script speed has been improved, detecting routers also been improved.

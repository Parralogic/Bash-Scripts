UPDATE! 11/12/2020
So far both methods working under my setup
enforcer|enforce4all
Security measures still in the works!
After timer ends and you exit it will remove all files created by bouncer2.4_5GHZ/airodump-ng
and revert back your wifi adapters to normal aswell as the enforcer*.sh scripts.


UPDATE! 11/11/2020
Some security measures have been addressed/rectified.. still in the works!
Example: If your not actually connected to your own router via wifi/ethernet script will terminate.
So far bouncher2.4_5GHz has the enforce4all function working simultaneously and re-validating clients
:On my setup.
Please run bouncer2.4_5GHz.sh first before plugging in any wifi adapters that are going to be
used for packet injection! 

UPDATE! 11/10/2020
Started writing the script...
